        We had the pleasure of attending the Outerbike Trade show in Killington, Vermont in July 2019, and we will be looking forward to meeting many more of you this year, as restrictions for gatherings are lifted. Bicycling has been a great way to exercise and maintain social distancing for the last year, and as we move into the coming year, we will be seeing you in person at a show near you.

        We have a wide selection of stock bikes for purchase and now orders for custom bikes can be placed on our website. Easily search our full line of accessories to make your cycling experience more perfect, or find replacement parts to make repairs at home. Our prices will leave you feeling like you got the best deal out there.
